            <p>RECIPE:
                For Chicken Filling:
                - Heat 4-5 tablespoons of oil in a pan.
                - Add half a kilogram of cubed chicken and cook until it turns white.
                - Add half a teaspoon of garlic, half to one teaspoon of vinegar, salt to taste, half a teaspoon of
                paprika powder, half a teaspoon of white pepper, and one to one and a half teaspoons of crushed red
                chilies.
                - Mix well and add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of chili sauce.
                - Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is tender.
                - Add sliced or chopped onions (I'm using 2 large onions) and cook until they soften.
                - Add 2-3 slightly chopped green chilies (I forgot to add them earlier).
                - Turn off the flame and add 4 tablespoons of tomato ketchup and 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise. Mix well
                and set aside.

                For the pita bread:

                - I'm using Dawn's ready-to-eat pita bread. Simply griddle them.
                - Press the pita bread from the middle with a spoon.
                - Add some salad leaves and the chicken filling we made.
                - Secure with a toothpick to keep it closed.
                - Enjoy your delicious pita bites!"
